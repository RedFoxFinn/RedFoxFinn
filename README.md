- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RedFoxFinn
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in backend and data-dev while can work with frontend
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently student at the University of Helsinki, department of Computer Science
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: development[dot]redfox{at}gmail.com

Some of my repositories here are programming assignments (both new and old can be found) and some are personal projects.

Used languages & frameworks:

- Java (before java 12 came out)
- JavaScript
  - React + Redux(-toolkit)
  - Apollo & Apollo-server(-express) for GraphQL
  - Node + Express
  - Cypress + Jest
- Dart & Flutter
- Qt (just light tinkering, but possibly use it some way later)
- Python
  - Tkinter (does its job, maybe?)
  - Flask, a bit of Django
  - pytest, a bit of robot framework
- R
